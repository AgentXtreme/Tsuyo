## A light-weight, multi-purpose Discord bot built with Discord.js.

### Features
- Currency/points system
- XP levelling
- Per-guild settings
- Fun games and commands
- Moderation and logging
- Helpful community and quality support

### Installation:
A couple of dependencies you will need:
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - A JavaScript runtime, it also has NPM built-in. 

Once NodeJS is installed, install the npm dependencies. For example; the code below will install the `discord.js` package.

- ```npm install discord.js```

Do this for each package in [package.json](https://github.com/TsuyoBot/main/blob/master/package.json#L13).

Now that the hard part is over, installation is a simple as a couple of clicks *(and patience depending on your internet speed)*. Simply download the latest release .zip from [here](https://github.com/TsuyoBot/main/releases), extract and run **_run.bat_** and you're done, it's that easy!

### Configuration:
By default, the only thing you will need to edit in **_config.json_** is the bot's token. If you're not sure on how to get a bot token, you can follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) made by our friends over at [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com/).

    {
    "token": "SEE-ABOVE-IF-NOT-SURE"
    }

Optionally, you can edit the other stuff too. If you're not sure what an option means, feel free to take a peak [here](https://github.com/Tsuyo/main/wiki/Config.js).

### Commands:
A full list of commands and how to use them can be found [here](https://github.com/TsuyoBot/main/wiki/Commands) as well as a guide to making your own commands.

### Contributing guidelines:
Due to the extremely long amount of text, you can find information on editing files, pull requests, merge requests and issues [here](https://github.com/TsuyoBot/main/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines).

### Don't want to host the bot yourself?
We have a public instance of the bot which you can add to your Discord [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=492871769485475840&scope=bot&permissions=1506142455).

### Didn't answer your question?
