## A light-weight modular Discord bot built with DiscordJS.
### Installation:
A couple of dependencies you will need:
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - A JavaScript runtime, it also has NPM built-in. 

Once installed, type the following into a command prompt:

```npm install discord.js```
```npm install got```

After that, installation is a simple as a couple of mouse clicks *(and patience depending on your internet speed)*. Simply download the latest release .zip from [here](https://github.com/VenkSociety/Cogent/releases), extract and run **_Cogent-Bot.exe_** and you're done, it's that easy!

### Configuration:
By default, the only thing you will need to edit in **_config.json_** is the bot's token. If you're not sure on how to get a bot token, you can follow the [tutorial](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) made by our friends over at [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com/).

    {
    "bot_name": "Cogent",
    "prefix": "/",
    "token": "SEE-ABOVE-IF-NOT-SURE",

    "loaded_msg": "Bot loaded.",
    "active_msg": "Cogent | /help",
    "error_msg": "There was an error trying to use that command.",
    
    "default_role": "welcome",
    "mod_role": "Moderator",
    "welcome_channel": "general",
    "log_channel": "logs"
	}

Optionally, you can edit the other stuff too. If you're not sure what an option means, feel free to take a peak [here](https://github.com/VenkSociety/Cogent/wiki/Config.js).

### Commands:
A full list of commands and how to use them can be found [here](https://github.com/VenkSociety/Cogent/wiki/Commands) as well as a guide to making your own commands.

### Contributing guidelines:
Due to the extremely long amount of text, you can find information on editing files, pull requests, merge requests and issues [here](https://github.com/VenkSociety/Cogent/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines).
